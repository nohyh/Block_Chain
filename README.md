### ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status: Work in Progress

**Please note:** This project is currently under active development. It is intended for educational purposes to explore blockchain fundamentals. The code is still being modified and debugged, and may contain errors or incomplete features.

---

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Wallet & Transactions**: Key pair generation and transaction signing using OpenSSL (ECDSA).
* **UTXO Model**: A full implementation of the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model for balance management.
* **Concurrent Mining (PoW)**: Simulates competitive mining using C++ multi-threading and a Proof-of-Work algorithm.
* **Blocks & Chain**: Implements a block structure with a Merkle Root, which is then verified and linked into a chain.
* **Network Simulation**: A transaction pool temporarily stores transactions waiting to be mined by competing miners.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Language**: C++20
* **Build System**: CMake
* **Dependencies**: OpenSSL
* **Concurrency**: C++ Standard Library (`<thread>`, `<mutex>`, `<atomic>`)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have a C++20 compatible compiler, CMake, and OpenSSL development libraries installed.

**On Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential cmake libssl-dev
```
**On macOS (using Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install cmake openssl
```

### 2. Build and Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/nohyh/Block_Chain.git](https://github.com/nohyh/Block_Chain.git)
cd Block_Chain

# Create build directory and compile
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Run the simulation
./BLOCKCHAIN_SYSTEM
```
Once running, the console will display real-time information about auto-generated transactions and newly mined blocks.
